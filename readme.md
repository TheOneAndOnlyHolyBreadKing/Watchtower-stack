# :bread: WATCHTOWER DOCKER-COMPOSE
This is my Docker Compose configuration designed for deploying WatchTower, enhancing control and management.

I assign hostnames to distinguish the sources of WatchTower notifications, aiding in server identification. If a hostname isn't specified, the container ID is automatically used in the subject line of email notifications.

This Docker-compose setup is here to make your server monitoring adventures way more exciting and organized!
